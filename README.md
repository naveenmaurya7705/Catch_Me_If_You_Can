# Catch Me If You Can

Catch Me If You Can is a simple web application that features a box whose size changes dynamically according to the viewport size. When you hover over the box, it will change its position randomly inside the viewport. The goal is to demonstrate dynamic resizing and random movement of an element using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mouse events.
